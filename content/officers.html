	<!--<h4>Contacting an Officer:</h4>
	<div>
		To contact an officer email them at their Bemidji State email address. To protect them against
		spam bots their emails are not listed on this page. However, if you follow the format:<br />
		<br />
		[First Name].[Last Name]@st.bemidjistate.edu
		<br />
		<br />
		and simply replace the [First Name] and [Last Name] with the first and last name of the officer you
		wish to contact, you have their email address. For Example, if the president was John Doe their
		email address would be john.doe@st.bemidjistate.edu.
