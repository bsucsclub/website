Problem A
---------
There are two errors in the sample output
of the problem statement:

The 3rd line of the sample input for scaling 
factor 1 should have 5 E's, not 4.

The middle part of "I" for scaling factor 2
should have 6 rows of double I's, not 4.


Problem E
---------
Assume that all input is lower case.


Problem F
---------
Although G(100) and G(125) are correct in the
sample output in the problem statement, we chose
to use input values that were less or equal to 65
in the Judge's input so that the output values would
fit in a 32-bit integer. The Sample I/O is correct,
but we announced prior to the contest that all outputs
would fit in a 32-bit integer. This was done to so
that Python programmers would not have a huge advantage
over the C, C++, and Java programmers on large integers.


Problem D
---------
The problem statement was fine, but we did adjust the
judge's input file so that all output values would fit in a
32-bit integer. The attached files reflect that change.
There was no need to send out a clarification on this since
we had made the announcement before the contest.
