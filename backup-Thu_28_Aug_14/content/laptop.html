</div>
<div>
<h4>About:</h4>
The generous people at <a href="http://www.federatedinsurance.com">Federated Insurance</a> have donated to the CS Club a laptop, and 
we have decided to give it away to one lucky member. For every meeting and event a member attends they will be able to put their name
in for a drawing. We will be having a club party next April to elect officers and to draw for the laptop. The more times you attend the
better your chances are to win! The club would like to thank Becky Dawley and everyone from Federated for this awesome gift! 
<h4>Laptop Specs:</h4>
coming soon...
<h4>Rules:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A member may enter 1 entry for the laptop drawing for each CS Club meeting or event they attend, up to 1 entry 
	    per day.</li>
	<li>If a club member takes the initiative to spearhead an event, and they see it to fruition, they may enter 2 entries 
	    for the laptop at that event.</li>
</ul>
<br />
GOOD LUCK!!<br />
